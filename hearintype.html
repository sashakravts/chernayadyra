    <div class="hearingtypep1">Three minutes out of it was transcribed and designed, according to all the details I can hear.

    <div class="hearingtypep2">Graphic design can be a tool to visualize almost anything. “Blah blah blah” is based on the lecture of  Walkers Art Insights by Sulki and Min Choi from 2016.

    <div class="hearingtypep3">The section where they talk about one of their works, where they redesigned eco-font by Spranq was chosen. This font, saves up to 50% of ink during printing and this is why that part interested me the most.</div>

    <div class="hearingtypep4">Main speaker’s speech was rehearsed, steady and even a bit monotonous, therefore I decided to make more subtle moves in terms of the design of the text.  </div>
    <div class="hearingtypep5">“Hearing text” was the concept around it.  Spacing between words was based on the seconds of pausing.</div>
    <div class="hearingtypep6">Phrases, which were pronounced faster than others are underlined with the words “speeding up” 4pt, so that you can only read it if you look closely.  Moments, where speakers correct themselves are crossed out.
    </div>
    <div class="hearingtypep7">This is a part of the collaborative publication and it is printed on recycled paper to support the concept of environmental friendliness. Several articles were analysed for me to see in what way you can represent different qualities of speech.</div>
