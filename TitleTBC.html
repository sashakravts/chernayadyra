      <p>Another way to evaluate the idea and bring it further is to ask questions related to the topic you work with, until you run out of them. When creating the infographics for “Title TBC”, the  project that was based on a persona who has a memorial plaque in Moscow, this approach was used.</p>

        The chosen persona happened to be Ekaterina Geltzer, who was a famous Soviet ballet dancer in 1920’s. While carrying out research on her, I came across many aspects of her life, such as the academy, where she studied, places she travelled, performances she took part at, etc.   
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="titletbcp3"><p>By asking questions for example “what parameters and characteristics you need to become a ballerina and get into that academy” I created more space and information for myself to work with.

  </p>

  </div>
  <div class="titletbcp4">The final result is based on the idea of tracking movement of head and legs of the ballerina during one of the performances in 1917, simplifying the amount of information shown, yet keeping it an interesting and interactive (due to the 2x3 meters size you could easily try and follow Geltzer’s movements) piece of work.
